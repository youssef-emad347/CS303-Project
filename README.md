### Problem Statment

Traditional bookstores often face challenges such as limited shelf
space, difficulty in managing large inventories, and limited reach to
potential customers. Furthermore, customers may find it inconvenient to
visit physical stores, especially when specific books are unavailable.
This project addresses these issues by developing an online bookstore
that provides a convenient platform for customers to explore and
purchase books anytime, from anywhere. The system also helps store
owners efficiently manage their book collections, track sales, and
provide better customer service.
